“So live your life so the fear of death can never enter your heart. 
Trouble no one about their religion; respect others in their views, and demand that they respect yours.
Love your life, perfect your life, beautify all things in your life. 
Seek to make your life long and of service to your people. 
Prepare a noble death song for the day when you go over the great divide. 
Always give a word or sign of salute when meeting or passing a stranger if in a lonely place. 
Show respect to all people, but grovel to none. When you arise in the morning, give thanks for the light,
for your life and strength. Give thanks for your food and for the joy of living. 
If you see no reason for giving thanks, the fault lies in yourself. 
Touch not the poisonous firewater that makes wise ones turn to fools and robs them of their visions. 
When your time comes to die, be not like those whose hearts are filled with fear of death, 
so that when their time comes they weep and pray for a little more time to live their lives over again in a different way. 
Sing your death song, and die like a hero going home.”
Tecumseh

“You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. 
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future. 
You have to trust in something – your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever. 
Because believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you the confidence 
to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well worn path; and that will make all the difference.”
– Steve Jobs

"It is not the critic who counts; 
not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 
The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, 
whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; 
who errs, who comes short again and again, 
because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; 
but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; 
who spends himself in a worthy cause; 
who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, 
and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, 
so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat."
- Theodore Roosevelt
